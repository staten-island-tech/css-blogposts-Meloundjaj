        <h1>Thrifting 101</h1>
        <h2> What you should be doing 24/7</h2>
        <p>Now that you have your matcha, book, and music you need the perfect setting. Yes a cafe works, but what better way than to be spotted at the THRIFT STORE, as you are now so progressed you dont belive in fast fashion and refuse to engage with anything of that nature</p>
